In my time with the world-class engineering team at Variance, I learned the difference between a well and poorly engineered application, agile development methods, and the importance of detail.

## What is Variance?

Variance is a software tool that allows companies to make how-to guides directly in an application. It sits on top of your business apps, helping to drive usage, alignment, and visibility. It can train users on features they're missing, help them find workflows right for them, and acts as a guide when they’ve lost their way.

In order for Variance to work, the software needs to know about the application it is sitting on. For instance, for Variance to work on Asana, it needs to know things like how Asana is organized and where the buttons are.

## My Role

This is where my role came in. I was in charge of mapping Asana, and many other applications, to Variance. This task involved going to every edge of these applications in the Chrome dev console, recognizing patterns in the app’s construction, and using those patterns to map the buttons and structure to Variance. The actual mapping is a combination of CSS, and regex.

Every Monday our team would have a meeting where we discussed our “Most Important Things” for the week. These were the high priority tasks that must get done. Then every Friday we would close the week with a meeting, celebrating what we had accomplished, and give demos of our completed work. Using an agile development method allowed the team to stay focused for short bursts while being able to change course where needed.

## Technical Takeaways

My biggest technical takeaway was learning what good application engineering looks like. After going through the code on every page of many applications, patterns started to emerge. The best companies reused pieces of their application over and over. They used the same easy to understand naming conventions, and were never too verbose. Except for Google Analytics, but they’re a special case.

On the other hand, more poorly made applications did not follow these guidelines. It was apparent where different teams had contributed to different sections, naming convention was different, and CSS classes were written multiple times. Because these teams did not pay attention to detail they made more work for themselves and exponentially more work for future engineers trying to understand their work.

## Unexpected Takeaways

On top of the technical takeaways, I benefited immensely through osmosis. Variance is led by Noah Brier and James Gross who were the founders of Percolate, the leading Content Marketing Platform for the enterprise. Over the course of our bi-weekly meetings, I got to watch, listen, and take notes on how they ran a business. I was blown away by how intellectual and multi-faceted they are. There wasn’t a topic that was brought up where someone wasn’t an expert. Their zeal to understand all subjects, not just the technical ones is one of the many ways I felt at home there.

Until next time!
